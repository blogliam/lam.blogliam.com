I've been planning to revamp my main portfolio website with what I have learned in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I just finished doing mockups of what I want the styling to be with my current skill set in mind.   

For lukeamakinson.com, my portfolio website, I am planning to go for something to the mockup below:

![portfoliomockup](/assets/img/lamlog/portfoliomockup.png)  

The main takeaways are I want to attempt some javascript rollover stuff where the A in my name rotates to different stylings and each button below my name does the same. I'm imagining switching to cursive, 8-bit text, 3D text etcetera. For the portfolio page I want it to start with 2 reels, one for filmmaking and one for general non-narrative media production. Below that, I'll have Narrative, Non-Narrative, and Interactive media descriptions that list what sort of projects those are and has some looping gifs of examples next to it. When you click on any of them it will take you to my view all page which is also accessible through a "view all" button at the bottom of the portfolio page. If you were to click on narrative, it would have the narrative tag selected and only show narrative media. You can fiddle with the sort by type tags while on the page to find other stuff too. Besides that, the site is pretty standard.  

For this site and my blog I plan to continue using jekyll as it makes content generation super easy for someone who is constantly adding new blog posts or portfolio pieces.  

For LAMLOG, my blog, I am planning to either just do one of these stylings or find a way to cycle through each either on a refresh or with a toggle button:

Each of these designs are inspired by different genre magazines I remember seeing as a kid. I especially liked fangoria. The rest I saw online mostly. I want to go for a weathered old magazine aesthetic. I might experiment with horizontal scrolling, but I think the site will work just as well without it. Main thing will be adding gaps between "pages" which would be the main landing page and each post. The size of each "page" will vary due to differing lengths of posts, but the gap between will be consistent and achieve the same affect.  

Jekyll will be hella useful for this in storing a bunch of tags and data to load constantly updating content on the front page. I'll have the 3 most recent posts and the date + post number of the most recent post updating on the front page.  

I also have a "browse by category" feature worked in there (inspired by <a href="https://gardna.blogliam.com/archive/">william's blog</a>). Not sure exactly how I plan to do that (if at all). I would need to work out a way to make it work with the overall aesthetic. Probably just loads a page that skips the front "page" and instead has a tag selector that will load posts in order that meet the selected tags. Simple enough.  

I am hoping to have all of this implemented by the end of December (the end of Fall quarter) which would make me totally on schedule to complete all the major projects I want to tackle this school year.
