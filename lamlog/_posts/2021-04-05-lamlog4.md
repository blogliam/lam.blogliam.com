title: HTML/CSS Training Through Blog Building
time: 2:31 AM the next day
---

Today I worked on building my second blog, [ibuycrap](https://lam.blogliam.com/ibuycrap/) where I am planning to host my physical media collection and other things I buy that interest me. In just today I was able to get a multitude of things completed. First off, I was able to make a quick placeholder logo for the time being, seen below:

Besides making the logo, I was also able to figure out altering the css, scss, and general directory of the website to achieve the look shown below. I altered Will's code that showed the time of posting to instead show the cost of the item I am posting about. Overall, I am quite surprised at how intuitive all this html/css and markdown stuff has become as I keep working on it. I can actually see myself being decently knowledgeable if I keep working at it. Pretty dope.

There are still several changes to be made before the site is fully functional:
1. Remove "LAMLOG" from website title
2. Figure out tagging of posts through Liquid (?)
3. Integrate tag feature into /music, /video, and /other webpages so they display the posts that fall under those tags
4. Figure out how to aggregate "price:" data point of each post into a counter at the top of the page
5. Post shit

Once this is complete, I will continue posting on both with little revision for a while. I want to get all three concepts for blogs I have up and running (in one form or another) before I do design overhauls of each blog. At least from my perspective, figuring out how to make each site functional takes priority before integrating pretty designs.  

The next blog after this will be "yardsale". The main challenge with this one will be finding a way to present a randomly selected blog post to the user. It also has the hardest visual design challenge as I want the user to almost interact with products at a yard sale.  

Time to stretch jekyll to its fucking limits.
