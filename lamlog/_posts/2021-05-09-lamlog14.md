title: Existing Blog Updates + New Blog

Over the past couple days I worked on finishing up the 2 existing blogs, LAMLOG and ibuycrap.   
1. Made a link back to the main blogliam hub on all blog pages
2. Updated the directory to include the new blog
3. Updated ibuycrap analytics
4. Included analytics on each tag page (Music, Video, Other)
5. Created markdown/layout/css files to begin work on a new blog

So, what is this new blog?  

Initially, I called this new blog idea "yardsale", however, I am changing the name to "boardwalk". This change is intentional as the old name only reflected a single idea I had for the blog. The single idea initially was to create a page that would output a random post when the user presses a button. Originally, I was going to reflect this idea as a yardsale where you might be able to purchase these posts or whatever. Then I thought this idea was better reflected as fortunes. Ultimately, I remembered those fortune teller machines that are at Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and other arcade settings:

From shifting from a yard sale to a boardwalk visual style and location, I also realized I can make a wider array of interactive experiences on one blog if I call it boardwalk. So, I plan to include the fortune teller idea, but also leave myself room to create more boardwalk themed interactive experiences.  

I will at least complete the fortune teller functionality before I move on to working on visual stylings of all my blogs. I am interested in what other experiences I can make within the constraints of my ability, web design, and the concept of "boardwalk".
