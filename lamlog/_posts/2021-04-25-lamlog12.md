So today I had to do some projects for my Sound Recording class using the equipment I loaned from my college.  

I ended up interviewing Henry for my Project #1:

For Project #2 I had to ADR a clip from the professor:  

{% include tools/embed.html source="youtube" id="1O6oOs8ny5U" %}

I was actually hella surprised at how hard it was to even get it remotely in sync. It took about 35 takes to even get it to where it is. I have major respect for actors who have to do this for movies lol.  

Also, here is a cool gif I made:
