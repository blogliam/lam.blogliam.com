Once again, heres a basically monthly return to this blog. I think posts might speed up again as I get back into school and stuff. I'll get more into that later in this post though. Anyways:

I've been working on and off on a little fan art project for a while now. I struggled to get it started, but eventually got to the planning/drafting phase a couple of days ago and drew these notes up:

Pretty much I was looking to emulate a DS ad using the stylings of an artist I like. Overall it would take photography, graphic design, and motion design to put it all together.  

You can check out the final product on my <a href="https://www.twitter.com/lukeamakinson">twitter</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lukeamakinson">instagram</a>  

Besides all that, I wanted to write about some general updates surrounding media production and life in general.  

In terms of my life:
- Currently in the process of buying a car
- Started new job in Color Guard Instruction which is another passion of mine
- Moving out of the house is in the horizon  

All of these factors are playing into my lack of momentum in media production which used to be insanely fast and exciting a couple of months ago. Right now, I have to focus more on day to day things and I have less time for small projects. Thus, I have been devoting my time to learning new media production skills and extending my focus onto bigger projects.  

What that pretty much looks like is me learning web development + javascript/game dev. I really want to venture into interactive media more than just video/photography/graphic design. I think its an incredibly valuable skill to have for the types of content I want to create.  

Speaking of that, I am working on learning three.js and javascript as a whole. I have a very ambitious idea that I can't shake for a 3D browser experience that ties into the new version of my website that I am working on.  

Thus, most of my time will now be spent learning and practicing programming + web design as I work on refining my online presence. I have a loose schedule I'm trying to hold myself to as I complete a large array of projects:

Pretty much this summer I'm working on making a coming soon page + trailer for the boardwalk 3D experience I will work on in the winter. I pushed boardwalk into the winter because over fall I'll be learning javascript in school which will put me on better footing to work on boardwalk. Besides that, in fall I'm gonna be doing a lot of html/css website building shit for my portfolio and this blog/ibuycrap. Finally, in spring I'm hoping to work on the infrastructure for "life+" (name tbd) which will be a network of similar 3D experiences to boardwalk, hosted on my website.  

Alright, thats all for now. Peace.
