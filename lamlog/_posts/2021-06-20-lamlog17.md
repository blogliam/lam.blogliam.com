Alright, seemingly bi-monthly blog, I am back to talk about shit.  

Aren't you happy!? :D  

So, over the past 2 weeks my film crew and I had a couple of recording sessions for our (currently untitled, still) short film.  

The set for the short film is the elementary school my mom works at. Overall, I was hoping to utilize the school at some point for a project as it is a very useful location to have access to. Our first day of shooting went smoothly besides a couple hick ups in which we forgot some props/equipment. Besides that, we were able to get the vast majority of necessary shots completed. That day was pretty tiring due to fight choreography and a lot of falls performed on my part.  

Now I noted we got the "vast majority" of shots which eludes to a reshoot day we had to do (today) a day before the film was due. There wasn't that much to film, we just added some additional padding shots to give better continuity across shots as well as filmed the final sequence.  

So, now comes a rapid fire day of post-production and sound engineering mostly headed by me! Pretty excited to get work on some foley punch sound effects.
