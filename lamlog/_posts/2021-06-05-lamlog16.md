title: Short Film PreProduction
time: 11:30 AM

So, I've been radio silent for my longest stretch of time since starting this blog. This isn't without reason as I've picked up a 2nd job working full time alongside my on campus job while I save for a car. Additionally, I have been working on a short film for my production class:  

Essentially the boiled down story is about a school janitor gone AWOL who fights two teenagers who litter in front of him. 

We are at a PreProduction stage in which we have a shot list and script written. The last bit of work being done is finalizing costuming and finalizing/practicing fight choreography. 

On Wednesday we worked on the fight choreography and simultaneously finalized the cinematography while on location

Thus, we are ready to film on our scheduled filming date with a possible (inevitable) re-shoot day looming ahead as well. Beyond that, we will edit together a rough cut essentially showing the chronological progression of each shot to turn in as well as a revised fine cut. And, finally, we will work on PostProduction color grading and vfx editing.  

Even at this stage, the biggest take away is that any production is more about management than anything. Keeping to a schedule and on top of everything that needs to be done is a struggle. Nonetheless, excited to continue this.
