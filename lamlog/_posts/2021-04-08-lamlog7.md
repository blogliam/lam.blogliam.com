I knew today was going to be a slow day from the beginning as I had a lot of homework for my business class (which I promptly dropped in a fit of rage). Nonetheless, I had a burst of creative energy at the end of the day and ended up designing a concept for the blogliam homepage utilizing my existing blogliam logo shown below:

This blogliam logo is from a design concept for flyers we might post in San Jose and Santa Cruz to promote the blog:

I ended up making a couple versions of the webpage shown below but settled on this one after speaking with Will and hearing his immediate positive reaction to this version:

After this design, Will requested a mobile version before he attempted any implementation which I made here:

The About page will  outline our gameplan for developing the blogliam network and the reasoning behind its creation (as well as possibly mini-bios of each blogger and what sort of projects they work on). The Contact page will have a central blogliam contact email as well as contact emails for each blogger. The Portfolio page will host any collaborative group work between a couple or all of the bloggers. Finally, the white squares in the above mock ups will host images of individual (and possibly some collaborative) projects and the images will either link directly to an offsite project or a blog post about the project.   

Tmrw I should have more sizable changes on the site done, but, I am quite happy with the unexpected work I was able to complete today.
