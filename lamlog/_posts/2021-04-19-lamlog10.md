title: Portfolio Update + Interesting Thought
time: 10:16 PM

Yesterday I added a <a href="https://lukeamakinson.com/blogliamcom-website">page</a>   detailing the Blogliam project in the Creative Projects section of my current portfolio. For now, it has all of the work that I have done in designing the landing page for blogliam.com as well as all of my personal blogs that I have developed. I plan to update this when major changes are made.

I was planning to finish the motion graphics in the <a href="https://lukeamakinson.com/portfolio">portfolio</a> section of my website, but, I decided it was sort of a waste of time. I am planning to completely rebuild my website from the ground up with a new visual style, so taking the time to make these motion graphics is sort of unnecessary. Instead, I included some placeholders to improve the user experience and highlight better where the user should click to access these previously blank sections.

Besides that little update, I came across and interesting concept that made me think about the feelings I currently have about my creative work and development as a artist/creator. The phenomena is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>:

It is essentially the idea that when you begin to learn a new skill your confidence rises at an immense rate due to your ignorance of the skill-ceiling that is truly above you. I definitely relate to that as when I began to take media production seriously with AYL I reached a peak of confidence in which I thought I could do anything.   

I feel as though I am either in the middle of the plateau shown above or I am on the slope downward. I am beginning to see the uphill battle of knowledge I can obtain in the broad subject of media production and design in general.  

This psychological theory definitely woke me up to why I may be feeling a slump as I continue to learn more and more each day. Importantly, though, it gives me hope that there is a future in which I regain my confidence and that this is a normal stage on the path to greatness.
