title: Blogliam Family Feast

So, I have a plan. It's quite an elaborate and honestly stupid plan, but, I think we can make something awesome out of this:  

Essentially, the last big project orchestrated by anyone in the "Blogliam Network" was AYL (areyoulistening.studio). This project, for those unaware, was a website in which you could construct and purchase a t-shirt of all of your favorite albums in a 3x3 grid. One of the sub-goals of this project (besides making a fuck-ton of money from this amazing idea) was to try to get a cease and desist from a record company for using their copyrighted album art. To the four teenagers working on that project, the idea that a giant multi-million dollar company would notice us (for any reason) was hilarious.  

That brings us to the new project idea:  

## <em>The Bløgliåm Family Feast</em> 🍔🍟

The lore of the Bløgliåm Family Feast is as follows:  
- The San Jose Mcdonald's chains are hosting a partnership meal with a group known as "Bløgliåm"
- Bløgliåm is a Norwegian Ethnic-Retro-Pop-Group
- Mcdonald's is selling multiple meals as part of a collective "Bløgliåm Family Feast" and each member of Bløgliåm has a meal named after them  

The online presence of this project will be:
- The Mcdonald's of San Jose, California Twitter Account: <a href="https://twitter.com/McDonalds_SJ">@McDonalds_SJ</a>
    - Funny anti-McDonald's propaganda/memes
    - Advertising for Bløgliåm Family Feast
- The Bløgliåm Twitter Account: <a href="https://twitter.com/blogliam_">@blogliam_</a>
    - Funny tweets from perspective of the band all written in Norwegian
    - Advertising for Bløgliåm Family Feast
- The McDonald's of San Jose, California Website: <a href="http://www.sanjosemcdonalds.com">sanjosemcdonalds.com</a>

The real world presence of this project will be:  
- Posters in San Jose Mcdonalds Stores
- Flyers in San Jose Mcdonalds Stores
- Flyers on light poles around San Jose
    - tear off coupons

Here is what has been done so far:
- Twitter accounts have been made

- Daily posts for April + May have been scheduled for both twitter accounts. 
- The San Jose Mcdonalds website domain name has been purchased. 

Here is what needs to be done:
1. Develop sanjosemcdonalds.com website
- create website design (mimicking a retro McDonalds website)
- write Bløgliåm about page and backstory 
2. Make Bløgliåm Family Feast Meals in real life
- Decide everyone's meals
- Create them in real life (i.e. Will makes a bacon butty)
- Take product photography of each meal 
3. Make Bløgliåm Family Feast Meal Advertisements
- Several Twitter Post sized advertisements
- Large Poster(s) designs
- Physical flyers with tear off coupons
4. Film pinned post for Bløgliåm twitter account of the Bløgliåm members saying hi to fans in Norwegian
- Possibly get funny wigs or something
5. Print physical media and disperse
- Print large posters
- Print flyers
- Box printed posters with a note from manager to put up (If it doesn't work, put up ourselves)
- Hang tear off coupon flyers on light poles
- Leave some flyers inside mcdonald's eating area

There is still room to develop more robust concepts for this project. However, I think what we have is a fun challenge while still being manageable. I think we can get this going during May and have it done within the month. I think a video documenting the whole project could be edited and released in June. 

Interested to hear everyone's thoughts and get to work on this.
