Yesterday I worked on designing a temporary logo for the LAMLOG blog that is currently being made. I took design inspiration from the sci-fi magazine "starlog".

I think I might change the overall design of the blog name to be honest. I think it works for now but I think I'm going to redo it in more of a 70s typography similar to that seen in the Mort Garson album Plantasia with a little bit of chemical brothers logo thrown in for good measure. Again, though, the logo will work for the time being and I might even make some design choices centered around it.

I am planning a couple of other sub-blogs that will have more distinct styles. One of them will be a blog talking about my recent physical media purchases as well as any other purchases that seem cool and I want to talk about. I believe I am going to call it "ibuycrap". I think I will go for an analog (tapes, paper, cds, vinyl) feeling for that website. I think some sort of counter that tracks how much money I waste on physical media and memorabilia would be funny as well.
 
I am also thinking about doing a blog where I just post philosophical affirmations, thoughts, and random ideas. I think I'm going to call it "yardsale". I think it will have a sort of sunny outdoor aesthetic and you can ask the seller what's for sale today and he will tell you a random post. That is the overall concept at least. I am definitely going to tweak it to be something I can pull off and/or mimic with simple html/css styling. 
 
The idea of doing a less specific logo than the one I have now with more room to design around (rather than pure sci-fi/comic book feeling) allows me to do other ideas on the site as well. I am thinking about making holiday versions of the logo that appear on certain days and could possibly be programmed to change when those days come? I would need to talk to Will about this. Alongside the logo changing, the accent tones of the website could change as well? Who knows. 
 
Another thing about the driving game will and henry are discussing is: What if you used tillable real world textures for absolutely everything, including the interior of the car? Henry already experimented with it for unreal world and I think we've found it's easy enough to do and could give it a weirdly realistic but also within an uncomfortable uncanny valley.
